# TinderTest-master
With VC's on storyboard

Full details and description: https://github.com/davidseek/SLPagingViewSwift-Swift-3-Tinder-Twitter

Current Issue to be fixed:

Apart from the 3 VC's of the tinder-like Navigation, i added a UI navigation controller with dismiss button on his root VC to
show the issue with the layout in ThreeVC which is different before the
present modally segue and after the  dismiss of the destination VC.

download the project to see the issue.

don't forget to start the project with the white icon, the TinderTest.xcworkspace, since the project uses cocoapods.
